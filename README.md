### **Description**

Wrapify is an application that allows users to summarize their listening habits on Spotify over varying time frames. This application was inspired by the annual Spotify Wrapped which at the end of the year, provides users with a fun and insightful report of their listening habits on the app over the last year with information on the number of minutes listened, top tracks, and much more. Wrapify is a simplified version of this. With Wrapify a user can login with their Spotify account to generate, save, and delete summaries of their listening habits all year round. Each summary consists of information on the user's top 10 tracks, top 10 artists, and top 5 genres for the specified time frame. There are 3 time frames a wrap can be generated for: short (last ~4 weeks), medium (last ~6 months), long (last ~1 year). Each wrap generated is stored in a MongoDB database and users can view and delete their past wraps from within the application. With Wrapify, users can get insight into their music taste year-round!
